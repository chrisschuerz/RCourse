##Useful sources:

- [RStudio Webinars](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-part-1/): The first webinars give a very good overview of R and RStudio. Worth watching as a beginner. (By the way there is also a webinar on debugging, as it was a question in Session 1).
- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/): Most R Programmers "live" almost there! Very strong community. Practical questions asked by real people to their real programming problems. Almost always very good answers given by real people. Best way is to google your questions and look for entries in stackoverflow.
- [The cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/): gives good examples to many problems as little recipes. So literally a cookbook!
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is a very well written detailed source and is available online. For you as beginners maybe the first four chapters of the part "Foundations" are interesting.
- [R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/): Host blog posts from different sources. Often share nice examples, announcements to new interesting packages, announcements to webinars, books (some are online for free!) etc.
