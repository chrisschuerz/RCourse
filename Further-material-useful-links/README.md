## Useful sources:

### General sources:
- [RStudio Webinars](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/webinars/rstudio-essentials-webinar-series-part-1/): The first webinars give a very good overview of R and RStudio. Worth watching as a beginner. (By the way there is also a webinar on debugging, as it was a question in Session 1).
- [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/): Most R Programmers "live" almost there! Very strong community. Practical questions asked by real people to their real programming problems. Almost always very good answers given by real people. Best way is to google your questions and look for entries in stackoverflow.
- [The cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/): gives good examples to many problems as little recipes. So literally a cookbook!
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is a very well written detailed source and is available online. For you as beginners maybe the first four chapters of the part "Foundations" are interesting.
- [R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/): Host blog posts from different sources. Often share nice examples, announcements to new interesting packages, announcements to webinars, books (some are online for free!) etc.

### Data wrangling:
- [Data Wrangling cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf): Very good overview of how you can "wrangle" your data, nicely illustrated by the guys from RStudio
- [Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html): Good examples given. Similar to what we did in the course, but more detailed explanation in the text.
- [Sean Anderson's Intro to dplyr](http://seananderson.ca/2014/09/13/dplyr-intro.html): Very nice blog post to dplyr. Good examples.
- [Sean Anderson's Intro to reshape](http://seananderson.ca/2013/10/19/reshape.html): He also wrote a nice post about reshaping your data. Good explanation of long and wide data format.
- [Info about tidy data](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html): Nice examples for tidying data by Hadley Wickham himself.


### Plotting:
- [ggplot cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf): As for data wrangling there is also a cheat sheet for ggplot. Print it out and pin it next to your work space. Highly recommended!
- [Chapter graphs in the cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/): Good recipes for ggplot, but also tips for basic plot functions and further tips such as line/point styles etc.
