##Useful sources:

- [The cookbook for R](http://www.cookbook-r.com/): gives good examples to many problems as little recipes. So literally a cookbook!
- [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wickham is a very well written detailed source and is available online. For you as beginners maybe the first four chapters of the part "Foundations" are interesting.
- [R bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/): Host blog posts from different sources. Often share nice examples, announcements to new interesting packages, announcements to webinars, books (some are free online!) etc.
